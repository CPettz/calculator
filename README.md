# calculator
Functional Calculator as part of The Odin Project curriculum

This calculator is mostly functional, however you cannot select multiple 
operators one after another. For example, if you try to do 3 x 3 x 3, you will
not get 27 as expected, you will instead get 3 x 33 = 99. 

I might come back to fix this functionality at a later date, but for now
this is how it works.
